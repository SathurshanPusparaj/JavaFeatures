/**
 * JDK 14 introduces records, which are a new kind of type declaration. Like an enum, a record is a restricted form of a class.
 * Itâ€™s ideal for "plain data carriers," classes that contain data not meant to be altered and
 * only the most fundamental methods such as constructors and accessors.
 *
 * Restrictions on Records
 *
 * The following are restrictions on the use of records:
 *
 * Records cannot extend any class
 * Records cannot declare instance fields (other than the private final fields that correspond to the components of the record component list); any other declared fields must be static
 * Records cannot be abstract; they are implicitly final
 * The components of a record are implicitly final
 * Beyond these restrictions, records behave like regular classes:
 *
 * You can declare them inside a class; nested records are implicitly static
 * You can create generic records
 * Records can implement interfaces
 * You instantiate records with the new keyword
 * You can declare in a record's body static methods, static fields, static initializers, constructors, instance methods, and nested types
 * You can annotate records and a record's individual components
